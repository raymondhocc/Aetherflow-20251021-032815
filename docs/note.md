# AetherFlow Documentation
Welcome to the AetherFlow documentation. This guide provides an overview of the platform, its core features, and how to get started with real-time data ingestion and analytics.
## What is AetherFlow?
AetherFlow is a cutting-edge real-time data ingestion and pipeline management platform. It's designed to seamlessly synchronize data from diverse enterprise sources, such as AS400 systems, into modern lakehouse architectures. The platform prepares and optimizes this data for advanced analytics, particularly for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs) to unlock deep business insights.
